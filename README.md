# ML-Modal on Bigmart-analysis
The domain which we chose for our SDL mini-project is Data Analysis. Data
analysis is defined as a process of cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful
information for business decision-making. The purpose of Data Analysis is to extract useful
information from data and make the decision based upon the data analysis.

## Abstract 
Sales forecasting is an important aspect of different companies engaged in retailing,
logistics, manufacturing, marketing and wholesaling. It allows companies to efficiently allocate
resources, to estimate achievable sales revenue and to plan a better strategy for future growth of
the company. In this paper, prediction of sales of a product from a particular outlet is performed
via a two-level approach that produces better predictive performance compared to any of the
popular single model predictive learning algorithms. The approach is performed on Big Mart
Sales data of the year 2013. Data exploration, data transformation and feature engineering play a
vital role in predicting accurate results. The result demonstrated that the two-level statistical
approach performed better than a single model approach as the former provided more
information that leads to better prediction.
In this project, we are analyzing a real world dataset, and to explore how machine
learning algorithms can be used to find the patterns in data. We were expected to gain experience
using common machine learning libraries, and predict some sales regarding taken dataset. After
performing the required tasks on a dataset of our choice, herein lies our final project report.
